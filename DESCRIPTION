Description: This package implements the Rank-Clustered Bradley-Terry-Luce model proposed by Pearce and Erosheva (2024+). More specifically, it fits a Bayesian model for ordinal comparison data of many different types (such as complete or partial rankings, pairwise comparisons, etc.) such that some objects being ranked may be "rank-clustered", i.e., assigned equal rank in the overall ranking.
