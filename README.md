rankclust
-----

The ``rankclust`` R package implements the the Rank-Clustered Bradley-Terry-Luce model proposed by [Pearce and Erosheva (2024+)](https://pearce790.github.io/). More specifically, it fits a Bayesian model for ordinal comparison data of many different types (such as complete or partial rankings, pairwise comparisons, etc.) such that some objects being ranked may be "rank-clustered", i.e., assigned equal rank in the overall ranking.
